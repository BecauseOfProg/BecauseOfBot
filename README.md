</div>

## üì≤ Requirements

- Ruby 2.1+
- A MongoDB database
- [Discordrb gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/discordrb/versions/3.2.1)
- [JSON gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/json/versions/2.1.0)
- [OpenWeatherMap gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/openweathermap)
- [Mongocore gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongocore)

## ‚è© First start

To use it, you must setup config.json (there is example with the samples).
When it's configured, you can start the bot with this command :

```ruby
ruby run.rb
```

After that, the bot is ready and you can add it to your guild ([Guide](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-authorization-flow))

## üîß Creating commands

To create a new command, you only must create a file in /src/commands/ of the name of your command.
In this file, you have to require command.rb and set the namespace to BoiteABois::Commands.
The class should inherit from Command.
When you add a new command, you must restart the bot.
Here is an example :

```ruby
require_relative 'command'

module BoiteABois
  module Commands
    class Example < Command

      CATEGORY = 'default' # Command category, defined in the config
      USAGE = 'example' # Command usage
      DESC = 'Description' # Command description
      #LISTEN = ['public', 'private'] # Listen for messages from public or private channel
      #ALIAS = 'another_command' # Alias to another command
      #SHOW = true # Visibility in the command list
      #CHANNELS = [] # Array of authorized channels
      #ROLES = [] # Array of authorized user roles
      #MEMBERS = [] # Array of authorized members

      def self.exec(args, context)
        # context is an instance of Discordrb::Message
        # args is an array of arguments
      end

    end
  end
end
```

## üìö Creating database models

All the models are defined in two files :

- `lib/db/models` : the Ruby class
- `lib/db/schemas` : the database schema, if required

The schemas are in the YML format. All is documented [on the mongocore gem page](https://github.com/fugroup/mongocore)
